# Crop-Management-Tool
This website manages and help farmer to sell their crop to the government online.
At first, farmers register themselves on the website after data verification farmers get their NFC cards which can help to identify themselves, and they get the proper pay.

# Features
1) I use IoT based Weight Machine system to directly upload the crop weight to main server so the government can track of it.
2) I connect the temperature sensor and deploy it to the cold storage to get the real-time temperature and humidity of that cold storage, to manage the crop properly.
3) NFC card-based transactions method is more secure.
